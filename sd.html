      <h2>Class 1</h2>
      <p>How are you functions to ask how you are personally, such as your emotional condition. Meanwhile, how are you doing tends to ask about your surroundings, such as your activities during the day. How are you doing is also commonly used when meeting friends who have not been seen for a long time. </p>
        
        <p>In addition to how are you , there is also how are you doing . Both have the same meaning, namely asking how you are in English, but their functions are different. Both are distinguished by the context of the conversation between you and the person you are talking to.</p>
        <p>Answers to How Are You
        When someone asks you how are you , the first answer that comes to mind is I'm okay . In fact, there are still many English words that can answer this question, here are some examples:</p>
    <strong>1. I'm Fine</strong>
            <P>I'm fine is the most common response to the question how are you when you are doing well. You can also shorten it to fine   and still have the same meaning. Here is an example sentence:</P>

        <p>Lizzie: How are you, Rudy?</p>
        <p>Rudy: I'm fine, thank you.</p>

    <strong>2. Very Well</strong>
        <p>When you are feeling excited, you can answer with very well . This answer to how are you means very good. Here is an example sentence:</p>
 
        <p>Lizzie: How are you, Rudy?</p>
        <p>Rudy: Very well. How about you?</p>
        <p>Lizzie: Me too.</p>

    <strong>3. I'm Great</strong>
        <p>I'm great is a response that means not much different from very well. The only difference is the impression created when you say it where it will seem more enthusiastic or excited. Here is an example sentence:</p>
        <p>
        Lizzie: How are you today, Rudy?<br>
        Rudy: I'm great. How about you?<br>
        Lizzie: Me too.
        </p>

    <strong>4. Not Bad</strong>
        <p>Not bad means 'not bad' or 'not bad'. You can use it when your news is between good and bad. Here is an example sentence:</p>
        <p>
        Lizzie: How are you today, Rudy?<br>
        Rudy: Not bad. How about you?<br>
        Lizzie: I'm great. (Good news)
        </p>
         <strong>5. So-so</strong>
        <p>So-so has the same meaning as not bad, not too good and not too bad.</p>

        <strong>6. I'm Hanging in There</strong>
        <p>When you are still going through a tough and tiring day, you can use this phrase when your friends ask how you are.</p>

        <strong>7. I've Been Better</strong>
        <p>This answer is usually said when you are not doing well. Literally I've been better means 'I was better'. When you answer with this phrase, be prepared to tell a story.</p>

        <p>Well, that's the explanation of the meaning of how are you and the answer. Hope it helps.</p>

      <h2>Class 2</h2>
      <h3>Unit 1: How Are You?</h3>
      <p>Greeting someone before starting a conversation certainly shows a friendly and polite attitude.</p>
  <p>Oh yes, greeting expressions also apply when you want to introduce yourself to others.</p>
  <p>However, if the greeting is in English, there are some etiquettes that you should pay attention to. Some of these etiquettes are:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose the appropriate greeting sentence</strong><br>
      Use English sentences that are appropriate to the time, situation, and person you are talking to. Don't greet someone older with a greeting that is too casual.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Look the person you are talking to in the eye and smile</strong><br>
      Show a friendly and sincere impression when greeting someone with a smile and a warm look at the person you are talking to.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pay attention to intonation and vowels</strong><br>
      Say the greeting in a friendly tone, but keep your pronunciation clear. Avoid using intonation that is too loud or too friendly so that the person you are talking to can understand the meaning of your greeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Names When Possible</strong><br>
      If you know the name of the person you are greeting, don't hesitate to use their name. Using a person's name can add a personal touch to your greeting, showing that you respect and remember them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be polite and respect the person you are talking to</strong><br>
      Remember to always be polite and respectful to the person you are greeting. Use friendly body language, maintain eye contact, and listen attentively to their responses.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>After understanding how to give greetings using English, now it's time for you to practice expressing them.</p>
  <p>To avoid mispronouncing them, the examples of greeting expressions below will guide you based on the time, situation, and conditions of their use.</p>
  <p>Curious about what they are? Check out the examples one by one, okay!</p>

  <h4>Greeting Expressions for Formal Situations</h4>
  <p>Greeting expressions in formal situations refer to how to greet and say hello in formal contexts. For example, in a school environment, formal events, business environments, or when interacting with older people.</p>
  <p>Greeting expressions in formal situations are important to note to show respect and politeness. Here are some examples of greetings in formal situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Hello, Sir/Madam.” (Hello, Sir/Madam.)</li>
    <li>“Good morning /Good afternoon/Good night.”</li>
    <li>“How do you do, Mr. Nadiem?” (How are you, Mr. Nadiem?)</li>
    <li>“Nice to meet you, Mrs. Nina!” (Nice to meet you, Mrs. Nina!)</li>
    <li>“It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Lina!”</li>
    <li>“May I introduce myself? I am Mary.”</li>
    <li>“Thank you for having me!” (Thank you for the opportunity!)</li>
    <li>“I appreciate your time, Mr. Rama.” (I appreciate your time, Mr. Rama.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using proper greetings in formal situations is essential for building good relationships with others, especially with elders or in professional settings.</p>
  <p>By using polite greeting expressions, we show respect, sincerity, and appreciation for the person we are greeting.</p>
  <h3>Unit 2: Talking about Family</h3>
      <p>Talking about your family can involve describing family members, their roles, and your relationship with them. You can discuss your family's size, traditions, and how you spend time together. Sharing stories or anecdotes about family experiences can also be a good way to engage in conversation.</p> 


      <p><strong>Describing Family Members:</strong><br>
  You can start by introducing the main members of your family, such as your parents, siblings, or grandparents. You can mention their names, ages, and what they do for work.</p>

  <p><strong>Roles and Relationships:</strong><br>
  Briefly describe the roles of family members, like "My father is a doctor," or "My mother is a teacher". You can also talk about your relationships with them, like "I get along well with my sister".</p>

  <p><strong>Family Size and Structure:</strong><br>
  You can discuss whether your family is small or large, and mention any other relatives, like aunts, uncles, or cousins.</p>

  <p><strong>Family Traditions and Activities:</strong><br>
  You can talk about family traditions you have, like celebrating holidays together or going on vacation. You can also describe how you spend time with your family, such as having dinner together or playing games.</p>

  <p><strong>Sharing Stories:</strong><br>
  An effective way to engage in conversation about your family is to share stories or anecdotes about family experiences. These stories can highlight funny or heartwarming moments.</p>

  <p><strong>Example Phrases:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"I come from a big family."</li>
    <li>"There are five people in my family."</li>
    <li>"My brother, [Name], lives in [City]."</li>
    <li>"We always have lunch together on Sunday."</li>
    <li>"I like spending time with my family because we have a lot of fun."</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Unit 3: Asking For directions</h3>
  <p>Asking comes from the verb “ask” which means to ask. Meanwhile, “direction” means instructions. Well, before asking for directions or instructions in English, there are several things you should pay attention to first, namely:</p>

  <strong>1. Greeting</strong>
  <p>As we have discussed in the article <em>16 examples of self-introductions in English</em>, a greeting is a greeting.</p>
  <p>When you want to ask for help from someone else, especially a stranger you have never met before, it would be a good idea to greet them first as a form of politeness to the person you are talking to.</p>
  <p>In addition, greetings are a great way to start a conversation in a friendly manner.</p>
  <p><strong>Example of greeting when asking directions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Excuse me / Excuse me Sir/Madam.</li>
    <li>Hi, I am sorry to interrupt you, but…</li>
    <li>Excuse me, could you help me, please?</li>
    <li>Hello / Hello Sir or Madam.</li>
    <li>May I ask you a minute Sir/Mam?</li>
    <li>Sorry for bothering you Sir/Mam!</li>
    <li>Pardon Sir/Mom!</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>2. Describe the Condition</strong>
  <p>After greeting, you can express your intentions and goals to the person you are talking to. In this case, you can also describe your condition or situation, or the reason why you need help from that person. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sorry, I am not from around here.</li>
    <li>I am new here.</li>
    <li>I’m lost.</li>
    <li>I seemed to be lost.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Grammar for Asking Direction</strong>
  <p>When you want to ask someone for help finding a place by asking directions in English, you can use the following grammar:</p>

  <strong>1. Asking using auxiliary modals</strong>
  <p>Previously, we have studied various auxiliary modals that are commonly used as formulas for tenses in English.</p>
  <p>In asking directions, the modals commonly used include <em>can, could, will, would, would like</em>, etc. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Could you tell me how to get to …?</li>
    <li>Could you tell me where the … is?</li>
    <li>Would you give me directions to go to …?</li>
    <li>Can you direct me to …?</li>
    <li>Would you show me the way to …?</li>
    <li>May I ask you the way to …?</li>
    <li>Can you show me the … on the map?</li>
    <li>I’m looking for …. Would you give me direction to get it?</li>
  </ul>

      <p>Daily activity is a daily activity carried out by a person from waking up in the morning until going back to sleep at night. Generally, daily activities are repetitive activities that have been carried out over a long period of time, for example, every day Ratna always makes breakfast at 06.00 am
        <h3>Transitional Marker</h3>
  <p>Between one sentence and the next sentence, a transition needs to be made. The following words can be used at the beginning of a sentence, namely <em>After that, Then, Finally, Firstly, Next.</em></p>
  
  <h3>Adverbs of Time</h3>
  <p>Even though it is done every day, there is nothing wrong with mentioning time information so that the sentence becomes more detailed and longer. Of course, it is also the right time marker to enrich the sentence. The following examples of words can be used as time information in English sentences: <em>in the morning, in the afternoon, at noon, in the evening.</em></p>
  
  <h3>Adverbial of Frequency</h3>
  <p>Because daily activity states an activity that is repeated every day, it is also necessary to mention how often it is done. Examples of words are <em>Seldom, Usually, Often, Never, Always.</em></p>
  
  <h3>Example of Text about Daily Activity</h3>
  <p>Making sentences about daily activities does not need to be long and is sufficient by using subjects, predicates and objects. Using Subject-Predicate-Object is already included in the short sentence structure. By focusing on basic sentences, your text will be easy to understand. Here is an example.</p>
  
  <h3>Example of a Student's Daily Text</h3>
  <p>Everyday, I wake up at 6 in the morning. After that, I take a bath and wear my uniform. Then, I have breakfast together with my family. I usually have some fried rice or toast. My mom asks me to drink milk every day, but I don't really like it.</p>
  
  <p>Then, I walk to go to school because it is near my house. I finish school at 4 and go home. I usually watch TV or read books in my room. Sometimes I clean the house or do my homework before dinner.</p>
  
  <p>We have dinner at 8 every day. We always try to eat together and chat while eating. Sometimes my dad or I come home late because of traffic or I have guitar lessons.
