      <h3> Steps to Make Announcement</h3>
     <p><strong>Creating an Opening</strong></p>
<p>As discussed in the previous article, announcements have three parts in their structure, namely <strong>Opening, Content, and Closing</strong>. Therefore, the steps for making an announcement must also follow the order according to its structure, yes!</p>

<p><em>Also read: Getting to Know the Types of Adverbs in English</em></p>

<p>The <strong>opening</strong> itself is the opening part of the announcement which contains the title and purpose of the announcement. In this section, you can use an opening sentence according to the context of the announcement. For example, if you want to make an announcement of a dance competition held by your school, then you can write <strong>"Rogu High School Dance Competition 2021"</strong>. Then, write the opening sentence like, <strong>"Rogu High School will hold a Dance Competition to celebrate the 127th Rogu High School's anniversary."</strong></p>

<p>In addition, you can also make other announcements that are slightly different from the competition announcements, for example the announcements you usually hear when riding a train. Well, announcements like this are included in <strong>public service announcements</strong>. In public service announcements, usually the opening sentence uses the phrase <strong>"Ladies and gentlemen, ..."</strong></p>

<p><strong>Writing Content</strong></p>
<p>After creating the opening section, you can proceed to the <strong>content</strong> section. The content section of the announcement contains detailed information about the thing being announced. For example, for the announcement of the Dance Competition, you can add information about the day and date of the dance competition, the location where it is held, and the time of its implementation.</p>

<p>Then, for the announcement on the train, you can write details about the name of the train, the route it will take, the name of the destination station, and the estimated time of arrival at the destination.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Closing</strong></p>
<p>Last step, you just add a <strong>closing</strong> to the announcement you made. The closing section itself usually contains information about the party making the announcement or a contact person who can be contacted for further information. For the Dance Competition announcement, you can add contact person information so that participants who want to register can directly contact the contact person.</p>

<p><em>Also read: Let's Learn about Present Continuous Tense!</em></p>

<p>As for announcements on the train, you can add a closing sentence in the form of an appeal to passengers to pay attention to their belongings and an appeal to contact the train crew if needed. Then, also include words of thanks and hopes that the passenger's journey will run smoothly and safely to their destination.</p>

<p><strong>Announcement Text Example</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example of an announcement text while on a train. For this example, it is not announced in writing, but rather verbally by an officer on the train. Pay attention to the following example!</p>

<p><strong>"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Argorogu train. This train will take us to Malang Station. The train will arrive at the final destination at 11.00 pm. Please mind your belongings and contact our crew for any service or information.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have a nice trip! Thank you.”</strong></p>

      <h2>Class 11</h2>
      <h3>Asking and Giving Suggestion (Advice)</h3>
      <p><strong>Suggestion</strong> in Indonesian means advice, input, recommendation, or suggestion. Well, <strong>asking suggestion</strong> is an expression that we can use to ask for advice/input/recommendation on something in English.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>giving suggestion</strong> is an expression that we can use to give advice/input/recommendations about something in English.</p>

<p>For example, you want to give a recommendation for a good coffee shop to your friend, so you can say, <strong>“You should try the new coffee shop down the street, the coffee and food are delicious.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tujuan Expression of Asking and Giving Suggestion or Advice</strong></p>

<p>As social beings, we definitely need other people in every aspect of life, yes. Even in decision making.</p>

<p>Well, the purpose of asking suggestion or advice is to help the decision-making process or problem-solving that we are facing. By asking for suggestions or advice from others, we not only get a new perspective, but also come up with ideas about how we can solve it.</p>

<p><strong>Example Dialogue 1</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Karina, has the result of the last English test been announced by Ms. Jennie?</p>
<p><strong>Karina:</strong> Yes, it has. Did you pass the test?</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Hmm, I was absent from the last meeting since I looked after my mom at home. So, I don’t know my score yet. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>Karina:</strong> Oh, you should see Ms. Jennie to check your score.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Thank you for your advice!</p>

<br>
<h3>Explanation Text</h3>
<p><strong>What is explanation text?</strong> Explanation text is a text that explains how and why a phenomenon happens. It includes both natural and social phenomena.</p>

<p>Hmm, what does that mean? So, <strong>explanation text</strong> is a text that explains how and why something can happen, either natural or social phenomena.</p>

<p>From the above understanding, we can conclude that <strong>explanation text</strong> functions to provide information through a detailed explanation of a phenomenon that occurs. That's why, the writing in the explanation text must be made in detail and answer the reader's questions.</p>

<p><strong>Where can you find this text?</strong> There are many, guys. Not only in school books, you can read explanation text from the news, internet articles, knowledge books, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Explanation Text</strong><br>
There are two types of explanation text, what are they?</p>

<p><strong>1. Sequential Explanation Text</strong><br>
This text explains a process based on sequence and time.<br>
Example: <em>How seawater becomes salty.</em> (How seawater can be salty.)</p>

<p><strong>2. Cause and Effect Explanation Text</strong><br>
This text explains the causes and effects of the phenomenon.<br>
Example: <em>Why people feel sleepy after a meal.</em> (Why do people feel sleepy after eating?)</p>

<p><strong>Structure of Explanation Text</strong><br>
Explanation text consists of four parts, namely <strong>title</strong>, <strong>general statement</strong>, <strong>explanation</strong>, and <strong>conclusion</strong>. Let's discuss them one by one.</p>

<p><strong>1. Title</strong><br>
The first structure is the title. The title of the text provides an overview of the contents of the text.</p>

<p><strong>2. General Statement</strong><br>
In the second part, namely the general statement, a general description of the matter described in the text will be explained.</p>

<p><strong>3. Explanation</strong><br>
Next, there is the explanation section. This section provides a series of processes on how and why something happens or cause and effect explained through a sequence of events. <em>FYI</em>, this explanation section can consist of more than one paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong><br>
Finally, there is the conclusion section, which contains the conclusions of the entire process that has been explained previously.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Novita Sari,</strong></p>

<p>I am excited to be applying for the Junior Journalist Role at your company. After reviewing your job description, I believe that I am the perfect candidate for the position. I have been writing news articles since I was in high school and I was also the leader of my school’s journalistic organization. In addition, I have been interested in RuangKoran since it won the Most Creative Publication Award last year. I am certain that I can collaborate with your editorial team and further develop Indonesian creative media.</p>

<p>I am a recent high school graduate and currently, I am in my first semester of college in Media and Communication major at Brahmana University. I graduated from high school with a high distinction due to my high exam scores and my extracurricular achievements. I gained my journalistic experiences in my school’s student newspaper. I started as a field reporter, in which I learned valuable skills, such as developing detailed articles and maintaining a resourceful knowledge in news topics. Later, I was promoted to the editor role, where I managed my team in producing creative content. Under my leadership, our newspaper won the award for the Best Student Newspaper in the state for two years in a row. I am confident that my proven skills will help me to contribute to RuangKoran’s success.</p>

<p>I look forward to having a discussion about the job in an interview. I hope that my skills and experiences will bring value to RuangKoran in the future. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely yours,</strong></p>
