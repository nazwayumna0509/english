      <h2>Class 7</h2>
      <h3>Unit 1: Noun</h3>
      <p><strong>Its function</strong> is to represent the mention of an object, one of which is as a subject or object in a sentence. Nouns have various types, three of which are distinguished based on their <strong>form</strong>, <strong>number</strong>, and whether or not the object can be counted. Let's discuss them one by one!</p>

        <p><strong>Types of Nouns</strong><br>
        First, based on their <strong>form</strong>, nouns are divided into <strong>concrete nouns</strong> and <strong>abstract nouns</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Concrete Noun</strong><br>
        Concrete nouns are objects that we can perceive with our five senses. Examples of concrete nouns are <strong>clothes</strong>, <strong>door</strong>, <strong>grass</strong>, <strong>road</strong>, and <strong>table</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract Noun</strong><br>
        Meanwhile, abstract nouns are things that exist, can be felt, but are not physically tangible. But not ghosts, hahaha. Some abstract nouns include <strong>ideas</strong>, <strong>thoughts</strong>, <strong>feelings</strong>, <strong>emotions</strong>, and <strong>concepts</strong>. Do you understand the difference?</p>

        <p><em>Also Read: Learning Countable Nouns and Uncountable Nouns</em></p>

        <p>Second, nouns based on their <strong>number</strong> are divided into two: <strong>singular nouns</strong> and <strong>plural nouns</strong>. What is the difference?</p>

        <p><strong>Singular Noun</strong><br>
        Singular noun is a name for a single object or an object that is one in number. Singular noun is usually written with the article prefix <strong>'a'</strong> or <strong>'an'</strong>. The prefix <strong>'a'</strong> is used when the name of the object begins with a consonant sound, for example <strong>a table</strong>, <strong>a chair</strong>, <strong>a book</strong>, <strong>a pencil</strong>, <strong>a fish</strong>, and <strong>a cat</strong>. If the object begins with a vowel sound, then the prefix <strong>'an'</strong> is used. Examples are <strong>an umbrella</strong>, <strong>an hour</strong>, <strong>an apple</strong>, <strong>an honor</strong>, and <strong>an elephant</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Plural Noun</strong><br>
        Objects that are more than one can be called plural nouns or in English are called <strong>plural nouns</strong>. To form a plural noun, you can add the suffix <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> after the noun. What is the difference?</p>

        <p>In general, to form a plural noun, you simply add the suffix <strong>-s</strong> at the end of the singular noun. For example, if you want to mention more than one <strong>friend</strong>, then you add <strong>-s</strong> after the word <strong>friend</strong> to form the plural noun <strong>friends</strong>. Likewise for other nouns, for example <strong>fruit</strong> becomes <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>book</strong> becomes <strong>books</strong>, and <strong>school</strong> becomes <strong>schools</strong>.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, for nouns ending in the letters <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-h</strong>, <strong>-x</strong>, and <strong>-y</strong> get the affix <strong>-es</strong>. Examples include <strong>buses</strong>, <strong>coaches</strong>, and <strong>butterflies</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Unit 3: Descriptive Text</h3>
            <p><strong>Descriptive text</strong> is a text that describes a particular object in detail. In Indonesian, descriptive text or <em>teks deskriptif</em> is a text that describes a specific object in a detailed manner. So, as mentioned earlier, in this text, you will describe the object clearly. It can include its size, color, shape, smell, and so on.</p>

            <p><strong>Purpose of Descriptive Text (Tujuan Teks Descriptive)</strong><br>
            The purpose of descriptive text is to describe or depict an object in detail. These objects can be <strong>people</strong>, <strong>animals</strong>, <strong>things</strong>, or <strong>places</strong>.</p>

            <p>For example, in a descriptive text about an animal, the content can include various information such as its physical description, food, habitat, origin, reproduction, and related unique facts.</p>

            <p>Remember, descriptive text only explains <strong>one particular object in detail</strong>. So, if you want to write a descriptive text, you can explain the characteristics of <strong>your pet cat</strong>, not describe all cats in the world.</p>

            <p><strong>Structure of Descriptive Text (Descriptive Text Structure)</strong><br>
            The identification section contains an introduction to the object to be described. For example, 'what is that object?' or 'where does that object come from?'. While the description section contains a more specific explanation of the object being described. In this section, you can explain the appearance and personality of the object.</p>

            <p>Well, the descriptive text explains about Hanni. The identification part is in the first, second, and third sentences. From this part, we can know that Hanni is the writer's good friend. Hanni is in the same class as the writer in junior high school. Then, the description part is in the fourth to sixth sentences. The writer explains Hanni's beautiful appearance. She has an oval face, round eyes, a high nose, and long hair. In addition, Hanni's friendly and smart personality is also explained.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Identification</strong><br>
            This section introduces the object to be described. For example, questions like “What is that object?” or “Where does it come from?” are addressed here.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Description</strong><br>
            This section contains more specific details about the object. In this part, you can describe the object’s appearance, features, behavior, personality, and other unique characteristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Language Features of Descriptive Text (Language Rules of Descriptive Text)</strong></p>

            <p>In writing <strong>descriptive text</strong>, there are language rules that you must follow. The <strong>language features of descriptive text</strong> consist of three elements, namely <strong>adjective</strong>, <strong>Simple Present Tense</strong>, and <strong>adverb of frequency</strong>. Let’s discuss them one by one!</p>

            <p><strong>1. Adjective</strong><br>
            Descriptive text is inseparable from <strong>adjectives</strong>. When describing an object, we definitely use adjectives, such as <em>big</em>, <em>small</em>, <em>tall</em>, <em>short</em>, <em>smart</em>, <em>friendly</em>, and so on.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Hanni is so pretty. She has an oval face, rounded eyes, pointed nose, and long hair. She is smart and friendly.</p>

            <p>The adjectives used in the descriptive text above are <em>pretty</em>, <em>oval</em>, <em>rounded</em>, <em>pointed</em>, <em>long</em>, <em>smart</em>, and <em>friendly</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Simple Present Tense</strong><br>
            <strong>Simple Present Tense</strong> is usually used to state facts, general truths, or habits. When describing an object, we use this tense because what we describe is usually factual and consistent.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Adverb of Frequency</strong><br>
            <strong>Adverb of frequency</strong> is an adverb that tells how often an activity is done. In descriptive text, we use it to describe the habits of the object.</p>

            <p><strong>Examples of adverbs of frequency:</strong> always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never.</p>

        <h3>Unit 2: Narrative Text</h3>
        <p>Narrative text is a type of text that tells a chronological story in the past tense. In Indonesian, narrative text is a type of text that tells a story in sequence in past tense sentences. Usually, this story is fictional and aims to entertain its readers. Therefore, the aim of narrative text is to entertain the readers through the amusing story. Remember, the purpose of narrative text is only to entertain its readers.</p>
        <p><strong>Language Features of Narrative Text (Language Rules of Narrative Text)</strong></p>

        <p>So, based on the example of narrative text with the title The Ugly Duckling above, let's look at the language rules in the following narrative text. </p>

        <p><strong>1. Past Tenses</strong></p>
        <p>Narrative text uses the past tense because the story takes place in the past. There are three types of past tense that often appear:</p>

        <p><strong>2. Adverb of Time</strong></p>
        <p>Narrative texts are usually told in a sequence of events or a storyline, which we call a plot. Therefore, adverbs of time are important to help guide the reader through the events.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Time Conjunctions</strong></p>
        <p>Time conjunctions are used to connect one event to another in a story. These help create a clear and logical sequence of events. Here are some examples of time conjunctions commonly used in narrative texts:</p>

      <h2>Class 9</h2>
      <h3>Unit 1: Conditional Sentence</h3>
      <p><strong>Conditional</strong> means depending on the condition when someone speaks. The definition of a conditional sentence is a supposition sentence when someone wants to express a condition that is different from reality. For example, <strong>"If the weather is nice, we can have a picnic."</strong></p>

<p>In this case, the condition may be something that could happen, or even something that is impossible to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional sentences</strong> consist of two parts, namely <strong>if-clause</strong> and <strong>result clause</strong>. Conditional clauses describe conditions or situations that must be met to produce the action described in the result clause.</p>

<p><strong>When Can We Use Conditional Sentences?</strong></p>

<p>Conditional sentences can be used when facing situations such as:</p>

<p><strong>1. Zero Conditional Sentence (Conditional Sentences Type 0)</strong><br>
Conditional sentence type 0 is a sentence to express conditions in the form of actions that are <strong>general truths</strong>, <strong>true statements</strong>, or events that commonly occur.</p>

<p>The formula for conditional sentence type 0 is:<br>
<strong>If + Subject + Verb 1, Subject + Verb 1 + Complement</strong><br>
which adopts the formula from the <strong>simple present tense</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you eat your lunch box, mother feels happy.</li>
  <li>Mother comforts me if I feel scared.</li>
  <li>If red mixes with white, it definitely turns out pink.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. First Conditional Sentence (Conditional Sentences Type 1)</strong><br>
In conditional sentence type 1, you can express conditions that <strong>may occur in the future</strong>. This sentence is also called <strong>future conditional type 1</strong> because it uses the <strong>simple future tense</strong> pattern.</p>

<p>The formula is:<br>
<strong>If + Subject + Verb 1, Subject + Will + Verb 1 + Complement</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are here, I will tell you my feelings.</li>
  <li>Anto will come if Putri invites him to her birthday party.</li>
  <li>If Desi and Ratu have their dinner late, they will catch a cold.</li>
